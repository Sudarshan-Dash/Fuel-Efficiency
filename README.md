Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Prediction

This project implements a Machine Learning model to predict the fuel efficiency (miles per gallon, MPG) of vehicles based on their characteristics. By leveraging a dataset containing features like engine size, weight, and horsepower, the model helps estimate MPG, aiding in performance analysis and optimization.

Features

1. Data Visualization: Explore relationships between vehicle attributes and fuel efficiency.
2. Machine Learning: Train a regression model to predict MPG.
3. End-to-End Pipeline: From data preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment.
   
Requirements

1. Python 3.x
2. Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, numpy

   Workflow
   
1. Data Loading: Load the vehicle dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data to identify patterns and trends.
3. Feature Engineering: Select relevant features for prediction.
4. Model Training: Use linear regression to build the prediction model.
5. Model Evaluation: Test the model's accuracy using appropriate metrics.
6. Deployment: Save and deploy the trained model for real-time predictions.
   
Results

The model achieves [insert accuracy metrics] on the test dataset.
